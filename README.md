gcm-client-library
==================

this client library thinks that you already know the basics of GCM.

If you do! proceed!


*just same old style with adding service and receiver in manifest.

*extend the abstract service, and the abstract receiver 

// this means register it to your server, use php or whatever you are comfortable with.
*extend the abstract GcmUtils implement one of the important methods registrationIdToBackground();

*after implementing your own GcmUtils setSender Id and url..

*and your goods to goes!
